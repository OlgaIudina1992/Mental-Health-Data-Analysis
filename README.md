# Background and aims:

In June 2022 Georgia submitted its  application to join the European Union, and, while the European Commission showed readiness to grant this request, it issued a recommendation for the country to address twelve standing priorities in its development. Among these priorities was combating gender inequality and violence against women [1]. Unfortunately, several forms of violent behavior against women in Georgia, such as domestic and sexual abuse, remain under-reported and under-investigated, in part, due to lack of consolidated effort in data collection [2, 22-23]. 

This research project was brought about by a discrepancy between NGO reports and available data from The National Statistics Office of Georgia (NSOG) [3]. On the one hand, it is generally assumed that experiencing domestic and sexual abuse is likely to cause mental health problems in women [4]. On the other hand, according to the available data, there is increased risk of mental illness in Georgian men, as well as higher mortality rate overall, even despite the sex ratio of newborns (108 boys are born for every 100 girls) [2, 2]. And while there is no explicit correlation between mental disorders in perpetrators of domestic violence and their behavior, mental health problems may lead to disruption in partner communication in relationships and tendencies towards sexual abuse [5]. Therefore, with reliable data on domestic and sexual violence against women being unavailable, several statistical sources from NSOG's gender section were investigated in an attempt to reach clarity on gender-related mental health state of Georgian population as one of violence-impacting factors. Additionally, the government's measures for mental health funding were analyzed in terms of effectiveness.
# Methodology:
This project relies on trend visualization with Pyplot and Seaborn to highlight visible trends in mental health, population dynamics and funding.
# Findings:
A number of striking visual trends were observed:
* A noticeable prevalence of mental disorder incidence in men within different time frames;
* An overwhelming prevalence of male suicides as compared with female ones, as well as only a recent decrease in mental-disorder-related deaths in men as opposed to those in women;
* Government-funded mental health treatment in Georgia is well-funded for adults within the 18-65 age bracket for both males and females, while such vulnerable groups as children and adolescents (0-17 age bracket) and senior citizens (aged 66-75+) receive little to no sponsorship;
* There is a marked discrepancy in funding for general disability vs mental health treatment for both sexes, and a significant gap between male and female mental health sponsorship, with females being at a disadvantage;
# Conclusions:
As the graphs illustrate, there is a clear need to address the issue of mental health support for both men and women in Georgia, and especially, raise awareness of mental illness treatment and suicide prevention among men . This can be achieved through social campaigns and advertizing, as well as volunteer work, particularly in the rural setting. Without such measures, even the much needed increase in funding may remain ineffective [6].
